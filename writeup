Lab04: Interrupt Based Scheduling
Chase E Stewart, Jonathan Wilson

Part 1: 2
Q1. Briefly explain the clock path from start to finish (crystal to SYSCLK), including explanations for all your major register configurations.



Part 2: 3
Q2. Describe how you determined your PWM frequency.

First, I looked online to find the period of the PWM signals and 
saw 10msec was a period within requirements. When I determined this, 
I set up the timer with the appropriate prescaler and period values 
in order to set PWM as required.

Q3. Describe how you would calculate CCR1 values for motors off, %50, and %100.
