Q1. What is the main role of the linker script? 

The linker script lets the compiler know how to budget the different
kinds of memory to be used in the program and where the locations of
these memory parts are. It starts by telling the compiler which program
to run at initialization, then it tells the beginning of the stack, the
size to budget for stack and heap, and then specifically the sizes of 
the different memory areas.


Q2. What does the ENTRY command in the linker script do?

The Entry command tells the compiler which function should be run first
at the start of the program. If it were 'main', the program would begin
by running the 'main' function. In the case of the example, however, 
the entry function is 'ENTRY( Reset_Handler )', which causes the 
program to start with the function 'Reset_Handler' instead.


Q3. Where in the STM memory map are the three ELF segments placed (i.e. flash, sram, system memory)?

from the .ld file, the three ELF statements are in these locations
  FLASH (rx)      : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 128K
  RAM (xrw)       : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 20K
  MEMORY_B1 (rx)  : ORIGIN = 0x60000000, LENGTH = 0K

Q4. What role does the startup file (startup_stm32f10x_md.s) play?

the startup file sets the initial stack pointer, sets the program
counter equal to the reset handler, sets the vector table entries,
and branches to main in the C library.


Q5. Can you get the red LED to flash? Why is this harder? This is a good example of some of the challenges you will face with embedded devices and why the reference manual/STM-examples are key.

In this case the red LED is connected to PB4, which is also the JNTRST pin, which is the JTAG reset pin. As we use JTAG to communicate with the crazyflie, sending a high/enable to the pin with it connected would cause problematic resetting on the crazyflie.
